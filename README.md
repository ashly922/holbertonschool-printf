This is the readme page for our first partner project at Holberton Tulsa, the project is titled printf.

The printf function is a popular and essential function in the C programming language that stands for "print formatted." It is used to display output on the console or terminal with specific formatting rules.

The printf function takes a format string as its first argument, which contains placeholders for various data types and literals. These placeholders are replaced by actual values or data during runtime based on the provided arguments. The printf function returns the number of characters that are successfully printed to the console.

Usage
The printf function has the following syntax:

int printf(const char *format, ...);

The first argument, format, is a string that contains the text to be printed to the console. It can also contain format specifiers, which are special characters that define the type of data to be printed and how it should be formatted. The format specifiers start with a % symbol, followed by a character that represents the type of data to be printed.

Here's an example of how to use the printf function:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    char ch = 'A';
    char str[] = "Hello, world!";
    
    printf("The number is: %d\n", num);
    printf("The character is: %c\n", ch);
    printf("The string is: %s\n", str);
    
    return 0;
}
Output:

The number is: 42
The character is: A
The string is: Hello, world!
